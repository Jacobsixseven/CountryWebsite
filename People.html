<p>The U.S. population is over 340 million, making it the third-largest country globally, with recent growth <br>
    driven by both natural increase (births exceeding deaths) and net international migration, showing a <br>
    significant rebound from pandemic-era low growth rates. This population, projected to reach over 341 million<br>
     by early 2025, includes the 50 states and D.C., with roughly 4.22% of the world's total inhabitants, while <br>
     Hispanic and other minority groups are key drivers of future growth. </p>

<p>On July 4th, Americans gather for festive picnics, parades, and barbecues, wearing red, white, and blue to <br>
    celebrate their nation's birth, often culminating in large fireworks displays lighting up the night sky with <br>
    patriotic fervor. For many, it's a cherished day to bond with family and friends, reflecting on freedom, while<br>
     for others, it's a time to consider deeper historical meanings of independence and equality. </p>

<p>Families built sandcastles and splashed in the waves at Clearwater Beach, while couples strolled along <br>
    Coronado's sandy shores, collecting seashells as the sun set over the Pacific. On a busy boardwalk in New <br>
    Jersey, teenagers laughed while eating ice cream, and surfers waited for the perfect wave, embodying the diverse<br>
     beach life across America's coasts. </p>

<p>American families are diverse in structure, with trends showing fewer married couples raising children and more <br>
    varied living arrangements like single-parent or cohabiting households, though the traditional ideal remains <br>
    influential. While marriage rates have shifted and family sizes have generally shrunk, core values of family <br>
    importance persist, even as friendships and careers also provide fulfillment. </p>
